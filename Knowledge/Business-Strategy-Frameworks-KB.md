| **Buyer Power** | Few large buyers? Price sensitive? Switching costs? | Concentrated buyers, commoditized products |
| **Threat of Substitutes** | Alternative solutions? Price-performance trade-off? | Many substitutes, low switching costs |
| **Threat of New Entrants** | Capital requirements? Economies of scale? Regulations? | Low barriers, easy entry |

**Strategic Implications:**
